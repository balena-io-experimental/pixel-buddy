# second-screen
Create a dedicated second screen to share moments that are meaningful to you.

The second-screen runs on any balena device with a screen, but we provide directions and 3D printing files for our refernce design (above) which we call the "pixel Buddy".

The second-screen pulls images from "sources" and stores them in a folder on the device. An image carousel container displays the images on an attached screen and also deletes the local images at regular intervals to save space and protect privacy.
